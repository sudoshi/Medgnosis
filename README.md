# Population Health Management (PHM) Database Foundation

A comprehensive data modeling solution for population health management, featuring a hybrid approach combining Inmon-style Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW) with Kimball dimensional modeling for analytics.

## Overview

This project implements a scalable database foundation for managing healthcare data for 700K to 1.5M adult patients, supporting both operational needs and analytical reporting requirements.

### Key Features

- Hybrid data architecture (3NF EDW + Star Schema)
- Support for clinical data from multiple EHR sources
- Comprehensive patient and provider data management
- Care gap analysis and tracking
- eCQM (Electronic Clinical Quality Measures) calculation
- Population health analytics and reporting

## Architecture

### Phase 1: 3NF Enterprise Data Warehouse
- Patient & Demographics
- Provider & Organization management
- Clinical data (Encounters, Diagnoses, Procedures)
- Observations & Lab Results
- Medications & Prescriptions
- Care Gap tracking
- Reference data management

### Phase 2: Analytics Star Schema
- Fact tables for encounters, diagnoses, procedures
- Common dimensions (patient, provider, date, location)
- Optimized for reporting and analytics
- Support for eCQM calculations

## Data Model Features

- Support for standard healthcare coding systems (ICD, SNOMED, LOINC, CPT, HCPCS)
- Comprehensive patient demographics and provider information
- Longitudinal healthcare data tracking
- Care gap identification and monitoring
- Quality measure calculation and reporting

## Technical Specifications

- Supports multiple EHR data sources
- HL7 v2 and FHIR-based API integration
- Staging area for data cleansing and transformation
- Robust patient matching capabilities
- HIPAA-compliant data security measures

## Requirements

- Enterprise-grade RDBMS (SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL)
- ETL/Integration platform
- Minimum storage for 1.5M patient records
- Support for concurrent access and reporting

## Security & Compliance

- HIPAA-compliant data handling
- PHI encryption at rest and in transit
- Role-based access control
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized for large dataset (1.5M+ patients)
- Efficient indexing strategies
- Partitioning for large tables
- Query optimization for reporting

## Getting Started

1. Review the data model documentation
2. Set up the database environment
3. Execute core schema creation scripts
4. Configure security and access controls
5. Implement ETL processes
6. Set up analytics schemas

## Documentation

Detailed documentation is available in the following sections:
- Architecture Overview
- 3NF Inmon Implementation
- Kimball Analytics Schema
- ETL from 3NF to Star
- PHM Frontend and UI/UX
